          <h3 class="question">Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?
          </h3>
          <p class="answer">As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help
            ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years
            of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on
            commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device (PFD). Many non
            swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety
            talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of
            the raft.

          </h3>
          <p class="answer">Gear up for an adrenaline-pumping white water rafting adventure! Pack smart with versatile
            clothing for scorching heat and chilly waters: think rain gear, quick-dry shirts, and shorts. Don't miss out
            on essentials like a stylish hat, adventure-ready sunglasses, and comfy socks. Strap on sturdy sandals or
            water shoes and grab a sleek day pack. Pack personal must-haves, sunscreen, and a trusty water bottle.

          </h3>
