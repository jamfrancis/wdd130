    <p>Hello! I am James Francis, and this is my first semester here at BYU-I. I finished my mission about a month ago, serving in the Utah Layton Mission. My family is from Indiana, and we live in a college town called Bloomington. Southern Indiana is full of forests and rolling hills, and in my free time I really enjoy going on hikes and backpacking trips. Including being in nature, my hobbies are varied and diverse. I enjoy exercising, playing the piano, singing, drawing, and learning about technology. I am very passionate about technology and love how it is constantly changing at a rapid pace. My major is in Computer Science, and I hope to pursue a career in that field. One area of particular interest for me is Artificial Intelligence. I feel like society is really beginning to see the positive and negative consequences of using AI. One reason I am hoping to explore that subject is to understand how we can use this technology to benefit society rather than tear it apart. We see this tearing apart in real time often on social media platforms that use sorting algorithms to serve content that will illicit an extreme response (and boost engagement), such as overwhelming positivity or overwhelming negativity. If you feel like rhetoric has become more divisive over time, this is one reason. I hope that I can understand these systems and systems like it in order to help them be more beneficial for the health of society.</p>
