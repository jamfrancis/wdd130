      Retail Sales Calculator
    </p>
    <p>
      Dive into one of my intriguing projects, the Retail Sales Calculator, where I combined my passion for programming with practical problem-solving skills. This web application stands as a testament to my proficiency in web development. The program takes customer subtotal as input and processes the total amount based on specific conditions. If the subtotal exceeds $50 and the day falls on Tuesday or Wednesday, a 10% discount is applied, followed by a 6% sales tax addition. For other days of the week or subtotals less than $50, only the 6% sales tax is added. With a keen eye for detail and a knack for efficient coding, I created an interactive interface where users can input their subtotal and instantly calculate the adjusted price. This project showcases my ability to transform complex retail calculations into a seamless digital experience, highlighting my expertise in both frontend and backend web development. Explore this project to witness how I turn intricate retail logic into a user-friendly application, bridging the gap between intricate algorithms and effortless user interaction.
