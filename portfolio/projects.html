                    <p class="card">
                        Dive into one of my intriguing projects, the Retail Sales Calculator, where I combined my
                        passion for programming with practical problem-solving skills. This web application stands as a
                        testament to my proficiency in web development. The program takes customer subtotal as input and
                        processes the total amount based on specific conditions. If the subtotal exceeds $50 and the day
                        falls on Tuesday or Wednesday, a 10% discount is applied, followed by a 6% sales tax addition.
                        For other days of the week or subtotals less than $50, only the 6% sales tax is added. With a
                        keen eye for detail and a knack for efficient coding, I created an interactive interface where
                        users can input their subtotal and instantly calculate the adjusted price. This project
                        showcases my ability to transform complex retail calculations into a seamless digital
                        experience, highlighting my expertise in both frontend and backend web development. Explore this
                        project to witness how I turn intricate retail logic into a user-friendly application, bridging
                        the gap between intricate algorithms and effortless user interaction.
